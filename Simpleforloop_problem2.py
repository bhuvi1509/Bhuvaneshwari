#Write a program that prints out the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number.
#example 1,2,3,5,8 , next number is the sum of previous two numbers.


num = int(input("Enter the number: "))
n1, n2 = 0, 1
print("Fibonacci Series:", n1, n2, end=" ")
for i in range(2, num):
    n3 = n1 + n2
    n1 = n2
    n2 = n3
    print(n3, end=" ")

print()
